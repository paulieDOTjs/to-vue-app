# to-vue-app

# Description
I created this app in conjunction with a youtube tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy9q22isx3U

# Installation
To start app open the app  in terminal, type in 'yarn install.' When that is done type in 'yarn start serve'

# Usage
This app was a learning experince more than an actual usage app. It pull from a pseudo database so there is no ability to save anything.
